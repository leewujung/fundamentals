# Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT)

This repository hosts the initial development of the tutorials for the Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) program.

We may break up this repository into multiple repositories as the materials grow and we invite others to join the effort.

## Repo structure
Below is a quick summary of what are in the folders:
- [conceptual](./boat_tutorials/conceptual/): tutorials aimed at building up a conceptual level of understanding that allow students to think about ocean acoustics problems in a holistic manner
- [in_depth](./boat_tutorials/in_depth/): tutorials aimed at digging into technical details of solving ocean acoustics problems and building in-depth understanding of specific topics.
- [primers](./boat_tutorials/others): primers introducing specific technical topics that are used in ocean acoustics problems ubiquitously.
- [images](./boat_tutorials/images): images used in the tutorial pages
- [matlab](./boat_tutorials/matlab): matlab LiveScript prototypes of Python interactive widgets
- [templates](./boat_tutorials/templates): templates from the JupyterBook starting pages for reference
