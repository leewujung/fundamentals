    "**Monostatic** means that the transmitter and receiver are located at the same place (co-located). This is the scenario typically seen in fisheries echosounders or bottom profilers, for which the same or nearby set of transducers are used to both transmit the probing signals and receive the returning echoes. In a monostatic setup, the returning echo signals are often referred to as **backscatter**, because they travel in the opposite direction (180$^\\circ$ angle) from the transmitted sound."
